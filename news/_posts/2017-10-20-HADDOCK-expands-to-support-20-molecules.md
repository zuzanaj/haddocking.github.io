With our recent [Nature Methods](https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.4392) publication we have now officially extended HADDOCK to support up to 20 separate molecules, expanding its capabilities as truly integrative modelling platform.

To deal with such a larger number of molecules, the initial random positioning of the components and the minimisation stage have been optimised. The paper also describes a method to select the most likely models after rigid-body docking and up-sample them during flexible refinement.

We hope in a near future to release a new version of our [HADDOCK web portal](haddock.science.uu.nl) that will support this new version, together with cryo-EM restraints among others. In the mean time this new HADDOCK version can be obtained for local installation upon request (the official distribution remains version2.2 at this time).
