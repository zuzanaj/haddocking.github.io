The service level agreement between the group of [EGI](http://www.egi.eu) resource centres and the [MoBrain](http://mobrain.egi.eu) research collaboration has been extended by one year.
The main objective of the MoBrain competence centre is to lower barriers for scientists to access modern e-Science solutions from micro to macro scales. 
MoBrain is represented by Prof. Alexandre Bonvin from the Faculty of Science, Utrecht University.
The MoBrain collaboration relies on the existing expertise available within the [WeNMR](http://www.wenmr.eu)/[West-Life](http://www.west-life.eu) 
and [N4U](http://www.neugrid4you.eu) projects and technology providers (NGIs and other institutions). It is also linked to the [INDIGO-Datacloud](https://www.indigo-datacloud.eu) and [BioExcel Center of Excellence](http://bioexcel.eu) projects.

In this 2018 SLA, **eight resource centres have pledged 60 million hours of opportunistic grid computing time, 60 dedicated core on the EGI Federated Cloud and more than 250 TB storage capacity to support the enmr.eu VO.** This year a new resource center from Spain, IFCA-LCG2, has joined the team of resource providers supporting the enmr.eu VO.

Thanks to this agreement, we will be able to keep accessing the High-Throughput Computing and File Storage services we need to support our [worldwide research community](http://www.targetmap.com/viewer.aspx?reportId=49690). This is particularly important for our [HADDOCK web portal](http://haddock.science.uu.nl/enmr/services/HADDOCK2.2) which is sending about 8 millions HTC jobs to EGI resources per year.
