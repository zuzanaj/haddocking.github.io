Our poster about GROMACS in the cloud presented by Mikael Trellet has won the poster prize at the [International Symposium on Cloud and Grid computing 2017](http://event.twgrid.org/isgc2017/) in Taipei.

Under the [WeNMR](http://www.wenmr.eu) project we have previously published our [grid-enabled GROMACS web portal](http://haddock.science.uu.nl/enmr/services/GROMACS)[1]. [GROMACS](http://www.gromacs.org) [2] is one of the world most used molecular dynamics suite. We demonstrated in this poster a new version of our GROMACS web portal that is now directly connected to the [EGI](http://www.egi.eu) FedCloud infrastructure via DIRAC [3], an interware that allows institutions to use grid or cloud resources through a simplified and generic framework. The [dirac.egi.eu](http://dirac.egi.eu) service integrates the necessary EGI services and infrastructure for the enmr.eu Virtual Organization, including [BioExcel](http://www.bioexcel.eu), [West-Life](http://www.west-life.eu) and others.
