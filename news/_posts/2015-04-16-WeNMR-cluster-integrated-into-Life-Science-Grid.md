SURFsara recently set up a new Life Science Grid cluster at the [Bijvoet Center for Biomolecular Research](http://bijvoet-center.eu) (BCBR) in Utrecht, replacing the [WeNMR](http://www.wenmr.eu) cluster that is used for molecular modelling. The cluster allows users to have access via a local user interface or grid environment giving access also to EU compute resources.

SURFsaraâ€™s [Life Science Grid](https://surfsara.nl/project/life-science-grid) (LSG) is a distributed cluster computing environment for large-scale data analyses or simulations, in particular suitable for multi-center studies that require a private virtual organization or calculations that require large amounts of compute resources. It offers 128 compute cores, a total of 512GB memory and 10TB scratch space for temporary datasets. For the preparation of input and output datasets a storage element is available with a net capacity of 40TB.
