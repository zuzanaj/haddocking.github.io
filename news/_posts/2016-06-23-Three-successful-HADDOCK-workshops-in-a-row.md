No less than three HADDOCK tutorials have been given in the last three weeks in Italy. The first one took place at the [University of Cagliari](http://www.unica.it/pub/english/), [Department of Physics](http://www.dsf.unica.it) early June, sponsored by [Sardegna Ricerche](http://www.sardegnaricerche.it).

It was followed by a HADDOCK day at the first [School on Molecular Modeling for Life Sciences](http://molmodel2016.dsf.unica.it/), which took place from 6th to 10th June 2016 in Pula, Sardinia, Italy.

The third workshop was help in Salerno preceeding the 13th annual [meeting of the Italian Bioinformatics Society](http://bits2016.bioinformatics.it/tutorials.html) (BITS2016). The group was well represented at BITS with a keynote lecture by [Alexandre Bonvin](http://bits2016.bioinformatics.it/speakers.html), and the best poster prize for Anna Vangone with her binding affinity prediction web server [PRODIGY](http://milou.science.uu.nl/services/PRODIGY). Congratulations Anna!

The tutorials covered various scenarios of HADDOCK from the basic protein-protein docking tutorial to more advanced ligand binding site screening as available on our [Education](/education) web page.

Such events also always provide an opportunity to advertise the expertise and e-infrastructure provided by various [European e-Infrastructure](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/h2020-section/e-infrastructures) projects such as [West-Life](http://west-life.eu), [INDIGO-Datacloud](https://www.indigo-datacloud.eu), [BioExcel](http://www.bioexcel.eu) with the support of [EGI](http://www.egi.eu).
