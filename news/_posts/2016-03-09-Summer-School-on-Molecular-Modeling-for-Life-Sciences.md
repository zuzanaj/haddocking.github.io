**We are pleased to announce the first edition of the School on Molecular
Modeling for Life Sciences which will be held from 6th to 10th June 2016
in Pula, Sardinia, Italy.**


The registration is now open and is *free of charge*. 

The *deadline* for registration is *May 15th 2016*.


The School is limited to a maximum of *40 participants*.


Applicants should submit a short CV and a motivation letter through the
Application form available at the website of the School.


The School aims at facilitating scientist from different disciplines to
get familiar with some of the key computational methods in molecular
biology, and is dedicated to doctoral, post-doctoral, and master degree
students.

The main goals are:

  - To give an updated overview of some of the following broadly widespread
computational techniques: structure-based homology modeling, drug-binding
sites detection and molecular docking, and classic molecular dynamics;
  - To make the attendants being able to use at the basic level one of the
most common packages developed within each of the aforementioned
methodologies;
  - To expose participants to timely scientific problems in
biological/medical research.

The School will consist of Lectures and Tutorials held by international
leaders in their disciplines, and it is addressed to physicists, chemists,
computational biologists, and anyone interested in learning how to use a
broad set of computational methods that are key to life sciences.

The School is funded by Regione Autonoma della Sardegna through the call
"SCIENTIFIC SCHOOL 2015" promoted by Sardegna Ricerche.
