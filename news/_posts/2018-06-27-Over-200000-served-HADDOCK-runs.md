Our [HADDOCK web portal](https://haddock.science.uu.nl) passed today the cap of over 200'000 served docking runs since June 2008. 40% of those have run on [EGI](http://www.egi.eu) / [EOSC-Hub](http://www.eosc-hub.eu) e-Infrastructure HTC resources, not to forget the strong support from the Dutch e-Infrastructure resources from [SURFSara](http://www.surfsara.nl) and [Nihkef](http://www.nikhef.nl) where about 70% of our jobs are running.


HADDOCK is one of the flagship software in the H2020 EU Center of Excellence project [BioExcel](http://www.bioexcel.eu).
