#Advanced methods for the integration of diverse structural data with NMR data#

**Date**     April 11-15 2016
<BR>
**Location**    [Bijvoet Center](http://www.bijvoet-center.eu), Utrecht University, the Netherlands.
<br>
<br>	
This course, organized for the project Instruct for structural biology, aims at training young researchers in the combined use of NMR data with other structural biology techniques, such as SAXS, X-ray diffraction or Cryo-EM in order to understand and rationalize the structural and dynamical properties of macromolecular systems. In addition, this course will introduce and make extensive use of user-friendly e-science portals to facilitate the adoption of the methods and techniques by the students in their everyday work.
<br>
<br>
The course will provide lectures describing the basics of the methods applied and hands-on training with the intuitive, web-based services of the [WeNMR infrastructure](www.wenmr.eu) and the [MoBrain](https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/EGI-Engage:WP6#TASK_SA2.5_MoBrain) Competence Center, the [West-Life](https://www.west-life.eu/) VRE and the [BioExcel](http://www.bioexcel.eu) Center of Excellence Horizon 2020 project. The hands-on sessions will allow the students to try the methods on either pre-packaged or their own research data. The course will address state-of-the-art tools and facilities.
