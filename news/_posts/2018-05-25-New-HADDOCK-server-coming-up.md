In the context of the [WestLife](https://about.west-life.eu) and [BioExcel](http://www.bioexcel.eu) EU projects we have been working hard on a complete new design (and machinery) of our HADDOCK portal. The new version (HADDOCK2.4) does support cryo-EM data and will allow multibody docking up to 20 molecules. 


We just published as a WestLife project deliverable a description of its implementation available in Zenodo (DOI:[10.5281/zenodo.1252961](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1252960)).


We will soon be looking for beta testers to get feedback before putting it in production mode.
So if you are interested, do contact us at *software.csb_at_bonvinlab.org*.
