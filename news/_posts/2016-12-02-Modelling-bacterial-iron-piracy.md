Check out the research story published on the [EGI](www.egi.eu) web site about modelling bacterial iron piracy from plant proteins. It describes among other how the HADDOCK portal helped to show that bacteria have a special drawbridge to steal iron from plant proteins.

HADDOCK is one on the [scientific application](https://www.egi.eu/use-cases/scientific-applications-tools/haddock/) which greatly benefits from the HTC resources of EGI to send over 8 millions jobs a years to distributed computing resources around the world.
