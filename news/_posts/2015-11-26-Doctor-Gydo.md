Yesterday (November 25th), Gydo successfully defended his PhD thesis entitled:

        "On Explorative and Integrative Modeling of Biomolecular Complexes"

His thesis describes new approaches and computational tools to
help structural biologists in interpreting data coming from increasingly
diverse sources (in particular cryo-EM data), and introduces a new vantage point to approach modeling
through explorative modeling.

Gydo's work over the last four year resulted in four 1st author [papers](/publications/index.md), 2 co-autor publications and one book chapter, with more to come! And next to implementing cryo-EM restraints into [HADDOCK](/software/haddock2.2/index.html), he also wrote two new programs, [PowerFit](https://github.com/haddocking/powerfit) and [DisVis](https://github.com/haddocking/disvis). All together a great performance!

Congratulations to the fresh doctor van Zundert for his well-deserved title!
