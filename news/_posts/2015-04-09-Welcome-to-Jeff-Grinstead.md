We welcome Jeff Grinstead in the CSB group. Jess is visiting professor from the [University of Pugetsound](www.pugetsound.edu) in Tacoma WA, USA, for four months (he previously spent time in the NMR group, obtaining a NWO-travel grant for it - spot him on our [group photo](http://www.bonvinlab.org/people/)...). Jeff has been working on protein-ligand HADDOCKing, something we still have to advertise more broadly, showing the capabilities of our flexible information-driven docking approach. This is what Jeff is intending to do.
