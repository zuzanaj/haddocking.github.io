The [BioExcel CoE](http://www.bioexcel.eu) is launching new series of educational webinars for computational biomolecular research. The series will cover broad topics related to the latest development of major software packages; their application to modelling and simulation; best practices for performance tuning and efficient usage on HPC and novel architectures; introductory tutorials for novel users and much more.

The webinars include an audience Q&A session during which attendees can ask questions and make suggestions. They are a great opportunity to interact with the main code developers.

Our first webinar in the series will be:

   * **Webinar:** *“Integrative modelling of biomolecular complexes with HADDOCK”*
   * **Presenter:** Alexandre Bonvin
   * **Date:** Friday,  Apr 29, 2016
   * **Time:** 16:00-17:00 CET (Central European Time)
   * **Registeration:** Free
