Another [H2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Fellow](http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/h2020-section/marie-sklodowska-curie-actions) will join our lab later this year in the person of [Dr. Irina Moreira from the University of Porto in Portugal](http://www.fc.up.pt/pessoas/irina.moreira/blog/?page_id=80). This is the second such grant coming to our lab - [Anna Vangone](http://www.bonvinlab.org/news/Marie-Curie-fellowship-for-Anna/) got a similar fellowship in the same round.
With this two years grant, Irina will work on developing novel methods to model the structure of membrane proteins and their interactions, and apply them to G-Protein Coupled Receptors.
