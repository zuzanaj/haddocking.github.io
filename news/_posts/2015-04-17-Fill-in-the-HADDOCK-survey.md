Dear (potential) HADDOCK users
<br>
<br>
We are asking you a few minutes of your time to fill in an online survey about our HADDOCK software.
It consists of 20 questions to obtain information on the usage of HADDOCK and on feature requirements. 
This information will be used for statistical purposes and to assess priorities in the development of new features. 
<br>
<br>
You can fill the survey online at: [http://goo.gl/forms/3IaqlqLC6g](http://goo.gl/forms/3IaqlqLC6g)
<br>
<br>
We thank you in advance for your participation.
<br>
<br>
Alexandre Bonvin & the HADDOCK development team
