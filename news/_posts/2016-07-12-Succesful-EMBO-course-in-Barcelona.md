Last week (July 4-9, 2016), the [EMBO practical course on Integrative Modelling of Biomolecular Interactions](http://events.embo.org/16-biomol-interact/) took place in Barcelona. The course, co-organized by [Alexandre Bonvin](http://www.uu.nl/staff/amjjbonvin), [João Rodrigues](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joaomrodrigues) and [Juan Fernandez-Recio](http://mmb.pcb.ub.es/~juan/) was followed by 24 enthusiastic participants, who listen to experts in the field, and followed computer practicals. An additional task assigned to participants was to predict the structure of a complex (target120) in the ongoing [CASP-CAPRI experiment](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/capri/round37/index.html). The participants were divived into five teams who could use whatever methods they like to come to a prediction. These were submitted to CAPRI as the EMBO2016 predictor team.
