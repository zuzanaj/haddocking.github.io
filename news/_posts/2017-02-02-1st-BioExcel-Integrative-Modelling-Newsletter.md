The BioExcel integrative modelling interest group offers a forum to discuss various approaches and software related to integrative structural biology and modelling. Its forum can be accessed [here](http://ask.bioexcel.eu/c/IG-IM).

The first newsletter has now been published. In it you will find:

* A short interview with the author of a software/method used in Integrative Modelling
* Highlights on one or two recent publications in the field
* A list of events (courses, conferences, workshops, webinars, ...) related to Integrative Modelling
* Some tips on software, scripts or web services that we would like to share with you

You can find a digest of all this information on the [main page](http://bioexcel.eu/integrative-modelling-ig/) of the BioExcel Integrative Modelling community.

You can register to receive the email version of this newsletter [here](http://bioexcel.eu/interest-groups).
