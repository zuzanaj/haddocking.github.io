### HADDOCK
  Software package for integrative modelling of biomolecular complexes

  * [**HADDOCK2.2 software**](/software/haddock2.2/)

  * [**HADDOCK web server**](http://haddock.science.uu.nl/services/HADDOCK)

  * [**HADDOCK grid-enabled web server**](http://haddock.science.uu.nl/enmr/services/HADDOCK)
<HR>
### [HADDOCKING GitHub repository](http://github.com/haddocking)
  The GitHub repository for HADDOCK and its associated tools

  * [**Binding_affinity: PRODIGY**](https://github.com/haddocking/binding_affinity):
  A collection of Python scripts to predict the binding affinity in protein-protein complexes.

  * [**DisVis**](https://github.com/haddocking/disvis):
  A Python package and command-line tool to quantify and visualize the accessible interaction space of distance-restrained biomolecular complexes.

  * [**Fraction of common contact clustering**](http://github.com/haddocking/fcc):
  Clustering of biomolecular complexes based on the fraction of common contacts

  * [**HADDOCK-tools**](http://github.com/haddocking/haddock-tools):
  A collection of useful scripts related to HADDOCK

  * [**PDB-tools**](http://github.com/haddocking/pdb-tools):
  A collection of Python scripts for the manipulation (renumbering, changing chain and segIDs...) of PDB files

  * [**PowerFit**](https://github.com/haddocking/powerfit):
  PowerFit is a Python package and simple command-line program to automatically fit high-resolution atomic structures in cryo-EM densities.

  * [**Samplex**](https://github.com/haddocking/samplex):
  Samplex is an automatic and unbiased method to distinguish perturbed and unperturbed regions in a protein existing in two distinct states (folded/partially unfolded, bound/unbound). Samplex takes as input a set of data and the corresponding three-dimensional structure and returns the confidence for each residue to be in a perturbed or unperturbed state.

### 3D-DART DNA modelling
  3D-DART provides a convenient means of generating custom structural models of DNA.

  * [**3D-DART server**](http://haddock.science.uu.nl/enmr/services/3DDART)

  * [**User manual**](http://haddock.science.uu.nl/enmr/services/3DDART/DARTusage.html)
<HR>
### Bioinformatics interface predictors

  * [**WHISCY**](http://nmr.chem.uu.nl/Software/whiscy/index.html)
  WHISCY is a program to predict protein-protein interfaces. It is primarily based on conservation, but it also takes into account structural information.

  * [**CPORT**](http://haddock.science.uu.nl/services/CPORT)
  CPORT is an algorithm for the prediction of protein-protein interface residues. It combines six interface prediction methods into a consensus predictor

### Benchmarks and datasets

* [Protein-DNA docking benchmark](http://haddock.science.uu.nl/dna/benchmark.html)

* Docking benchmark of membrane protein complexes ([GitHub](https://github.com/haddocking/MemCplxDB)) and associated decoy dataset [ https://doi.org/10.15785/SBGRID/618]( https://doi.org/10.15785/SBGRID/618)

* Cleaned Docking Benchmark 5 dataset, HADDOCK-ready, with unbound and bound structures matched: [https://github.com/haddocking/BM5-clean](https://github.com/haddocking/BM5-clean)

* HADDOCK docking decoys for the new entries (55) of the protein-protein Docking Benchmark5: [https://data.sbgrid.org/dataset/131/](https://data.sbgrid.org/dataset/131/)

* HADDOCK refined models for the biological/crystallographic interfaces collected in the DC and MANY datasets: [https://doi.org/10.15785/SBGRID/566](https://doi.org/10.15785/SBGRID/566)
