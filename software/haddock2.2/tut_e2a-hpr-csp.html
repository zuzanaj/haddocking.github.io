<HR>
In order to validate the HADDOCK program, we initially performed the docking on three 
known complexes (see the 
<a target=new href="http://pubs3.acs.org/acs/journals/doilookup?in_doi=10.1021/ja026939x">HADDOCK paper</a>. 
We are providing in the <b>haddock/examples</b> directory the data for all three complexes.
This tutorial deals however only with the E2A-HPr complex. The structures in the free 
form<sup>1,2</sup> and NMR titration data<sup>3,4</sup> are available. The complex structure
had been solved experimentally by NMR<sup>5</sup> (PDB entry 1GGR).
<ul>
	<b><i>Note</i></b> that the example uses the NMR solution structure
           of HPr (entry 1HDN) to allow the docking from an ensemble of
           conformations. Because of that, the definition of active and
           passive residues might differ from the one in the HADDOCK
           paper since the filtering is based on the average accessibilities
           (see the <a target="new" href="/software/haddock2.2/generate_air_help#filter">AIR restraints</a> section).

<BR><BR>
To start this tutorial, first copy the <b>protein-protein</b> directory from the <b>haddock2.2/examples</b> directory:
<pre>
  cp -r $HADDOCK/examples/protein-protein .
</pre>
<ul>
   <b>Note:</B> The <b>$HADDOCK</b> environment variable should be defined if haddock was
                properly installed.
</ul>
Go into the <b>protein-protein</b> directory.
<BR><BR>
You will find in there the PDB files of the E2A and the HPr proteins:
<pre>
 - e2a_1F3G.pdb
 - e2aP_1F3G.pdb  (with phosphorylated histidine)
</pre>
<BR>
For HPr, we will use the first 10 conformations from the PDB entry 1HDN. These can be found
in the <b>hpr></b> directory:
<pre>
 - hpr_1.pdb
 - ...
 - hpr_10.pdb
</pre>
<BR>
The file containing the listing of those 10 structures for docking from an ensemble
of structures is provided <b><i>(Note: edit it to modify the directory path!)</i></b>:
<pre>
 - hpr-files.list
</pre>
<BR>
The PDB file of the reference complex can be found in the <b>ana_scripts</b> directory 
and is called
<pre>
 - e2a-hpr_1GGR.pdb. 
</pre>
<BR>
The (average) per residue solvent accessibilities calculated with 
<A target="new" HREF="http://wolf.bms.umist.ac.uk/naccess"> NACCESS</a> 
(see the <a target="new" href="generate_air_help#ensemble">AIR restraints</a> 
section) are also provided for convenience
<pre>
 - e2a_1F3G.rsa
 - hpr/hpr_rsa_ave.lis
</pre>
<BR>
You also find a number of additional files containing the AIR restraints that we
used for calculations,
<pre>
 - e2a-hpr_air.tbl
</pre>
<BR>
a number of <a target="new" href="http://www.umass.edu/microbio/rasmol/index2.htm">Rasmol</a>
scripts for visualization (see the "Defining AIRs" section) of the active and 
passive residues for E2A and HPr,

 - e2a_rasmol_active.script
 - e2a_rasmol_active-passive.script
 - hpr_rasmol_active.script
 - hpr_rasmol_active-passive.script

<BR>
and to define all the <a target="new" href="/software/haddock2.2/docking">parameters for docking</a>
<pre>
 - run.cns-refe
</pre>
<BR>
(see the <a href="#parameters">Defining the parameters for the docking and running HADDOCK</a> 
section for usage and parameter definitions)
<BR><BR>
Various analysis scripts can be found in the <b>ana_scripts</b> directory. They will allow you
to calculate the interface RMSD (i-RMSD) (RMSD calculated on backbone atoms of all residues within 10A 
from the partner molecule) and ligand RMSD (l-RMSD) (RMSD calculated on the smallest 
component (hpr) after fitting on the largest component (e2a)). These are standard 
<a href="http://capri.ebi.ac.uk">CAPRI</a> definitions. A script is also provided that allows 
you to calculate the fraction of native contacts. For usage and details refer to the <i>README</i> file in the <b>ana_scripts</b> directory.
<BR><BR>
Finally, a script to copy data from an example HADDOCK run is provided as:
<pre>
 - copy_hadddock_files.csh
</pre>
<hr>
<BR>
<B>2.</B> <a name="AIRs"><b><u>Defining the AIR restraints</u></b></a>
<BR><BR>
Some general explanations about how to define the interface can be found 
in the HADDOCK <a target="new" href="/software/haddock2.2/generate_air_help">AIR restraints</a> section.
<BR><BR>
For this particular example, based on the available NMR titration data<sup>3,4</sup>,
and the relative solvent accessibilities, we defined 11 active residues for <b>E2A</b>:
<ul>
   <li><i>active</i>: D38, V40, I45, V46, K69, F71, S78, E80, D94, V96 and S141
</ul>
and 10 active residues for <b>HPr</b>:
<ul>
   <li><i>active</i>: H15, T16, R17, A20, F48, K49, Q51, T52, G54 and T56
   <BR><BR>
   <b><i>Note:</i></b> The active residues and the filtered ones
         can be viewed in 
	 <a target="new" href="http://www.umass.edu/microbio/rasmol/index2.htm">Rasmol</a>
         using the provided Rasmol scripts, <i>e2a_rasmol_active.script</i> 
         and <i>hpr_rasmol_active.script</i>. For example for E2A, start rasmol with
<pre>
    rasmol e2a_1F3G.pdb
</pre>
and then, at the rasmol prompt type:
<pre>
    RasMol> source e2a_rasmol_active.script
</pre>
The active residues are colored in red and the filtered-out active residues (if any) in yellow. 
For Hpr, three active residues were filtered out because they are not solvent accessible. 
These are residues 50,53 and 55.  Control in the <i>hpr_rsa_ave.lis</i> file giving the 
relative solvent accessible surface area per residue for hpr that these three residues 
are indeed not solvent accessible (The criteria used is <aveRSA>+SD > 50%).
</ul>
You will now have to <i><b>define the passive residues</i></b>. For this, for each structure 
in turn (E2A and HPr), load a PDB file in Rasmol, highlight all active 
residues (in Rasmol source the corresponding <i>e2a/hpr_rasmol_active.script</i>) and
pick all neighbors of active residues. Filter then the selected residues with their
solvent accessibility (see the <a target="new" href="/software/haddock2.2/generate_air_help#filter">
filtering residues</a> or <a target="new" href="/software/haddock2.2/generate_air_help#ensemble">filtering
from an ensemble of structures</a> sections).
<BR>
<ul><b>Note:</b> Rasmol scripts containing all the active and passive 
                 residues that we defined for E2A and HPr are provided for 
		 comparison (<i>e2a_rasmol_active-passive.script</i> and
		 <i>hpr_rasmol_active-passive.script</i>.

		 For both <b>E2A</b> and <b>HPr</b> we defined 9 passives residues:
		 <BR><BR>
		 <ul>
		    <li> <i>E2A passive</i>: P37, V39, E43 G68, E72, E97, E109 and K132
		    <BR><BR>
		    <li> <i>HPr passive</i>: P11, N12, Q21, K24, K40, S41, L47, Q57 and E85
		 </ul>
</ul>
Having defined active and passive residues for both molecules, you can now <i><b>generate the
AIR restraint file</b></i> for use in HADDOCK. For this go to the HADDOCK 
<a target="new" href="/software/haddock2.2/haddock-start">project setup</a> section, click on 
<b>"generate AIR restraint file"</b> and follow the instructions.
<BR>
<hr>
<BR>
<B>3.</B> <a name="newproject"><b><u>Setup a new project for HADDOCK</u></b></a>
<BR><BR>
To start a new project in HADDOCK you have to define a number of files such as
input PDB files for both molecules, various restraint files and the path and name
of the project. For this, go again to the
<a target="new" href="/software/haddock2.2/haddock-start">project setup</a> page, click on
<b>"start a new project"</b> and follow the instructions.
<BR><BR>
After saving the <b><i>new.html</i></b> file to disk, type <i>haddock2.2</i>
in the same directory. This will generate a run directory containing all necessary
information to run haddock. See the <a target="new" href="/software/haddock2.2/start_new_help">"a new project"</a>
section on the HADDOCK home page for more information and for a description of the
content and organization of the generated run directory.

<ul>
<b><i>Note:</i></b>An example of a <i>new.html</i> 
              file can be found in the <b>haddock/examples/protein-protein</b> 
              directory as

</ul>
<hr>
<BR>
<B>4.</B> <a name="parameters"><b><u>Defining the parameters for the docking and running HADDOCK</u></b></a>
<BR><BR>
The next step consists in editing the various parameters that will govern the
docking process in the <b><i>run.cns</i></b> file in the newly generated run directory. 
For this, again go to the <a target="new" href="/software/haddock2.2/haddock-start">project setup</a> page, 
enter the path of the <b><i>run.cns</i></b> file and click on <b>"edit</b>.
Refer to the <a target="new" href="/software/haddock2.2/run">run.cns</a> section for a description
of the various parameters.
<BR>
<ul><b>Note:</b> Most of the parameters in <i><b>run.cns</b></i> are set by default
                 for the e2a-hpr example and you will only need to modify a few of those.
		 <BR><BR>
		 <li> Check the various paths to your project directory and the filenames
		 to be used (<a target="new" href="/software/haddock2.2/run#names">"Filenames"</a> section)
		 <BR><BR>
		 <li> Check the definition of the semi-flexible interface 
		 (<a target="new" href="/software/haddock2.2/run#interface">"Definition of the interface"</a> 
		 section). The default in HADDOCK2.2 is -1, meaning that the semi-flexible
		 interface will be automatically defined by HADDOCK from a contact analysis.
		 <BR><BR>
		 <li> Check the number of structures to generate at the various steps
		 and decrease those if needed (strongly recommended if you are going
		 to run all the structure calculations on a single processor).
		 (<a target="new" href="/software/haddock2.2/run#numstruc">"Number of structures to dock"</a> section)
		 <BR><BR>
		 For the present tutorial, keep the default parameters (1000 structures
		 for the rigid body docking stage and 200 afterwards). You will not perform
		 a complete HADDOCK run but simply copy the data from the provided example
		 run directory and move on with the analysis of the results
		 <BR><BR>
		 <li> Check the queue commands for running the jobs, the location of the
		 cns executable and the number of jobs to run simultaneously.
		 (<a target="new" href="/software/haddock2.2/run#jobs">"Parallel jobs"</a> section)
		 <BR><BR>
		 For the present tutorial, use <i>csh</i> as queue command and 1 as number
		 of jobs. The CNS executable path should be properly set.
		 <BR><BR>
</ul>

Once you have properly set all parameters, save the modified <b><i>run.cns</i></b> 
file to disk. 
<BR>
<ul>
<b><i>Note:</i></b>An example of a <i>run.cns</i> 
              file can be found in the <b>haddock/examples/protein-protein</b> 
              directory as 
	      <a target=new href="../examples/protein-protein/run.cns-refe">run.cns-refe</a>.
</ul>
You would now be ready to run HADDOCK by simply typing <i>haddock2.2</i>
in the same directory and the docking will start.
<BR><BR>
A description of what happens in the various HADDOCK steps can be found in the
<a target="new" href="/software/haddock2.2/docking"><i>the docking</i></a> section of the
online HADDOCK manual.
<BR><BR>
Examine now the content of the various directories. The generated structures of the
complex can be found in:
<ul>
   <li><i><b>structures/it0</i></b>: structures after rigid-body docking
   <li><i><b>structures/it1</i></b>: structures after semi-flexible simulated annealing
   <li><i><b>structures/it1/water</i></b>: structures after water refinement
</ul>
In each of these directories you will also find three files containing the list
of sorted structures in various format for use by CNS and HADDOCK:
<ul>
   <li><i><b>file.nam</b></i>: list of PDB filenames only
   <li><i><b>file.list</b></i>: list of PDB filenames for use in CNS with the 
                                <a href="/software/haddock2.2/run#scoring">haddock 
                                score</a> that has been used for sorting
   <li><i><b>file.cns</b></i>: list of pdb filenames in yet another cns format.
</ul>
<hr>
<BR>
<b>5.</b> <a name="analysis"><b><u>analyzing the docking results</u></b></a>
<BR><BR>
in <i><b>structures/it1</b></i> and <i><b>structures/it1/water</b></i> you will find an
<i><b>analysis</b></i> directory containing the results of the analysis automatically 
performed by haddock. refer to the <a target="new" href="/software/haddock2.2/analysis"><i>analysis</i></a>
section of the online haddock manual for a description of the various analysis performed
and inspect the content of some of the described files (mainly those with extensions <i>.disp</i>
and <i>.lis</i>.
<BR><BR>
An important part come now: <b>the manual analysis of the results</b> (see also the 
related <a target="new" href="/software/haddock2.2/analysis#manual">manual analysis</a> section of 
the online haddock manual). since typically the restraints used to drive the docking 
are highly ambiguous, several solutions will be generated. clustering the solutions 
and performing a manual analysis is therefore required. a number of scripts are 
provided in the <b><i>tools</i></b> directory for this purpose. 
you can either copy them to the directory into which you will run the manual analysis or
call them using:
<pre>
  $HADDOCKTOOLS/script_name
</pre>
a first typical step is to gather various energetics violation and rmsd from lowest energy
structure statistics. the <i>ana_structures.csh</i> script can be used for this purpose. it makes
use of <a href="http://www.bioinf.org.uk/software">profit</a></b> for rmsd calculations if
present and defined.
<BR><BR>
go into the <b><i>structures/it1/water</i></b> directory and run the analysis:
<pre>
  cd structures/it1/water
  $HADDOCKTOOLS/ana_structures.csh 
</pre>
the csh script will extract information from the headers of the pdb files and
calculate the backbone rmsd from the lowest energy structure. it generates a number
of files, <i>file.nam_bsa</i>, <i>file.nam_ener</i>, <i>file.nam_rmsd</i> and 
<i>file.nam_viol</i> containing respectively the buried surface area, various energy terms,
the backbone rmsd from the lowest energy structure and the violations statistics.
<BR><BR>
the generated files are combined into one file called
<ul>
   <li><i>structures_haddock-sorted.stat</i>
</ul>
that keeps the pdb file order defined in <i>file.nam</i>. a number of additional files 
are then generated with various sorting schemes:
<ul>
   <li><i>structures_air-sorted.stat</i>: sorting based on distance restraint energy
   <li><i>structures_airviol-sorted.stat</i>: sorting based on number of distance violations
   <li><i>structures_bsa-sorted.stat</i>: sorting based on buried surface area
   <li><i>structures_Edesolv-sorted.stat</i>: sorting based on the empirical desolvation energy
   <li><i>structures_dh-sorted.stat</i>: sorting based on total "binding" energy (sum of the 
          total energies (both bonded and non-bonded terms) of the individual molecules - total
	  energy of the complex)
   <li><i>structures_ene-sorted.stat</i>: sorting based on total energy (sum of various
    restraints energies and intermolecular van der waals and electrostatic energies)
   <li><i>structures_nb-sorted.stat</i>: sorting based on non-bonded intermolecular energy
   <li><i>structures_nbw-sorted.stat</i>: sorting based on weighted non-bonded intermolecular energy ( 1*evdw + 0.1*eelec)
   <li><i>structures_rmsd-sorted.stat</i>: sorting based on rmsd from lowest haddock score structure
   <BR>
</ul>
These files are useful to generate various plots such as for example intermolecular
energy versus rmsd from the lowest energy structure to visualize the clusters. The
graphic program <b><a href="http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace/">Xmgr/Grace</a></b>
can be used for this purpose. To facilitate things, we are providing a csh script that
will generate a xmgrace file called <i>ene_rmsd.xmgr</i> by specifying an input file 
and the column numbers to be plotted:
<pre>
   $HADDOCKTOOLS/make_ene-rmsd_graph.csh 3 2 structures_haddock-sorted.stat
</pre>
Columns 2 and 3 correspond to the HADDOCK score and backbone rmsds from the lowest 
HADDOCK score structure, respectively. You can then visualize it with:
<pre>
   xmgrace ene_rmsd.xmgr
</pre>
<font color=red>
<ul><b>Question:</b>Considering the plot of the HADDOCK scores versus rmsds from the lowest HADDOCK score structure,
how many clusters do you expect?
</font color=red>
</ul>
You could in a similar manner make plots of other terms. The first line of the
<i>structures_....stat</i> files gives a description of the various columns. 
You could also repeat this kind of analysis after rigid-body docking (<b><i>it0</i></b>)
and after semi-flexible annealing (<b><i>it1</i></b>). Note that the rmsd calculations 
for the rigid-body solutions might take a while considering that 1000 structures
where calculated at that stage.
<BR><BR>
The next step consists in clustering the solutions based on the backbone rmsd
matrix calculated by HADDOCK in the analysis directory. The RMSDs are calculated by
first superimposing the structures on the flexible interface backbone atoms of molecule A 
and calculating the RMSD on the flexible interface backbone atoms of the other molecules. 
This RMSD can be termed: "ligand interface RMSD". The matrix (half of it) is stored in the
analysis directory in a file called <i>fileroot_rmsd.disp</i> where <i>fileroot</i>
is the root name used for HADDOCK and defined in the <i>run.cns</i> file.
<BR><BR>
Go into the <b><i>water/analysis</i></b>, locate that file and perform the clustering
with the <i>cluster_struc</i> program provided with HADDOCK. 
<pre>
   $HADDOCKTOOLS/cluster_struc e2a-hpr_rmsd.disp 7.5 4
</pre>
<i>e2a-hpr_rmsd.disp</i> is the file containing the rmsd matrix, 7.5 the rmsd distance cutoff 
in Angstrom and 4 the minimum number of members to define a cluster. See also the 
<a href="/software/haddock2.2/analysis#rmsd">pairwise RMSD matrix</a> section of the analysis manual page.
<BR><BR>
The output looks like:
<pre>

</pre>
where the structure numbers in the clusters correspond to the position of the PDB file
in the <i>file.nam</i> file (or directly to the number of the structures in the 
<b><i>analysis</i></b> directory.
<BR><BR>
Try different cutoffs and compare the results. With a too small cutoff no clusters or only
very small clusters are found. When increasing the cutoff, the clusters will grow and some
might merge. There is no ideal value. It depends on the degree of flexibility present in
the structure, the restraints used for docking and, therefore should be optimized for
each system. A common cutoff value we are using is 7.5A. For more details see the <a href="/software/haddock2.2/analysis#cluster">clustering</a> section of the analysis manual page.
<ul>
    <b>Note:</b> When searching for a proper cutoff, it is a good idea to check how many
                 structures do fall into a cluster. This number can be obtained for example
		 by executing the following command and substract 3 times the number of lines,
	         e.g.:
<br>
<pre>
   $HADDOCKTOOLS/cluster_struc e2a-hpr_rmsd.disp 7.5 4 | wc
      5     210     738
</pre>
                 The first number give the number of lines and second number corresponds to 
		 the numbers of words. This means in this example that 210-(3*5)=195 structures 
		 do cluster. Ideally, you would like a large number of structures to cluster
		 (at least 50%). The structure numbers correspond to the rank of the 
		 HADDOCK-sorted structure. It is also advised to check if the best structures do
		 appear in one cluster.
</ul>
<BR>
Once you have found a proper cutoff, repeat the clustering, saving this time the
output to a file, e.g.:
<br>
<pre>
   $HADDOCKTOOLS/cluster_struc e2a-hpr_rmsd.disp 7.5 4 >cluster7.5.out
</pre>
<BR>
This file can now be used to analyze the solutions on a cluster basis and obtain cluster
average values for the various energy terms, violations, ... For this, go back into
the <b>water</b> directory and use yet another provided analysis script called 
<i>ana_clusters.csh</i>:
<pre>
   ana_clusters.csh: calculates average energies and RMSDs on a cluster basis
 
     usage: ana_clusters.csh [-best num] clustering_file_output
 
     The -best option allows to specify how many structures are being used to
     to calculate the average cluster values. If specified, additional files with
     extension .stat_best_num will be created.
</pre>
<BR>
Run the analysis, specifying how many of the best (lowest energy) structures are
being used to calculate cluster averages and the path and name of the file containing
the output of the cluster_struc program:
<pre>
   $HADDOCKTOOLS/ana_clusters.csh -best 4 analysis/cluster7.5.out
</pre>
<BR>
This script generates a number of files containing for each cluster the average
backbone rmsd from the lowest energy structure of the cluster, the average backbone
rmsd from the overall lowest energy structure, the number of members of the cluster,
the various average energies, violations, buried surface area with the respective 
standard deviations:
<ul>
  <li><i>clusters_haddock-sorted.stat</i> contains the various cluster averages, sorted
         accordingly to the HADDOCK score
  <li><i>clusters_ene-sorted.stat</i> contains the various cluster averages, sorted
         accordingly to the intermolecular energy  (restraints+vdw+elec)
  <li><i>clusters_dH-sorted.stat</i> contains the various cluster averages, sorted
         accordingly to the binding energy (sum of the total energies (both bonded and 
	 non-bonded terms) of the individual molecules - total energy of the complex)
  <li><i>clusters_Edesolv-sorted.stat</i> contains the various cluster averages, sorted
         accordingly to the empirical desolvation energy
  <li><i>clusters_nb-sorted.stat</i> contains the various cluster averages, sorted
         accordingly to the intermolecular non-bonded energy  (vdw+elec)
  <li><i>clusters_nbw-sorted.stat</i> contains the various cluster averages, sorted
         accordingly to the weighted intermolecular non-bonded energy  (vdw+0.1*elec)
  <li><i>clusters_air-sorted.stat</i> contains the various cluster averages, sorted
         accordingly to the AIR energy  
  <li><i>clusters_bsa-sorted.stat</i> contains the various cluster averages, sorted
         accordingly to the buried surface area
  <li><i>clusters_sani-sorted.stat</i> contains the various cluster averages, sorted
         accordingly RDC (direct, SANI) restraint energy
  <li><i>clusters_vean-sorted.stat</i> contains the various cluster averages, sorted
         accordingly to the RDC (intervector projection angles, VEAN) restraint energy
</ul>
and for each cluster, the three files used by CNS and HADDOCK containing the
energy sorted cluster members:
<ul>
   <li><i>file.nam_clust#</i>
   <li><i>file.list_clust#</i>
   <li><i>file.cns_clust#</i>
</ul>
If the <i>-best</i> option is used additional files are produced with <i>_best#num</i>
as extension containing the average values and the PDB filenames for the #num best
structures of each cluster.
<BR>
<ul><font color=red><b>Question:</b>
Perform the cluster analysis and look at the HADDOCK-sorted results. What we would consider
the best solution would be the cluster with the lowest HADDOCK score. Since clusters typically
differ in size, it is best to compare the results of the cluster averages obtained from the XX 
best structures only (so that a similar number of structures are considered per cluster).
Which cluster would be the best? How many members does it count?

<BR><BR>
Having performed the cluster analysis, you can now rerun the HADDOCK analysis for the
best structures of each cluster to obtain various statistics on a "cluster bests" basis.
One needs for this the cluster-specific <i>file.nam_clust#</i>, <i>file.list_clust#</i> 
and <i>file.cns_clust#</i> files.  A csh script called <i>make_links.csh</i> is provided 
that will move the original <i>file.nam</i>, <i>file.list</i> and <i>file.cns</i> files
to <i>file.nam_all</i>, <i>file.list_all</i>, <i>file.cns_all</i> and the same with the
<b><i>analysis</i></b> directory. It will then create links to the appropriate files 
(<i>file.nam_clust#</i>,...) and to a new <i><b>analysis_clust#</b></i> directory.
<BR><BR>
For example, to rerun the analysis for the best 10 structures of the first cluster type
in the water directory:
<pre>
   $HADDOCKTOOLS/make_links.csh clust1_best4
   cd ../../..
   haddock2.2
</pre>
The <i>cd</i> command brings you back into the main <i><b>run</b></i> directory
from where you start again HADDOCK. Only the analysis of the best 4 structures
of the first cluster in the <b><i>water</i></b> will be run. Once finished, go to 
the respective analysis directory and inspect the various files.
The rmsd from the average structures should now be low (check <i>rmsave.disp</i>).
<BR><BR>
Repeat this analysis for the second cluster.
<br>
<hr>
<BR>
<B>7.</B> <a name="compare"><b><u>Comparing the clusters and the reference structure</u></b></a>
<BR><BR>
Having run the HADDOCK analysis on a cluster basis you should now have two new directories
in the <b><i>water</i></b> directory:
<ul>
   <li><b><i>analysis_clust1_best4</i></b>
   <li><b><i>analysis_clust2_best4</i></b>
</ul>
Each analysis directory contains now cluster specific statistics. You can also visualize
the clusters. For Rasmol, use first the <i>joinpdb</i> perl script to concatenate the
various PDb files into one singe file:
<pre>
   $HADDOCKTOOLS/joinpdb -o e2a-hpr_clust1.pdb e2a-hprfit_*.pdb
</pre>
and then start Rasmol with:
<pre>
   rasmol -nmrpdb e2a-hpr_clust1.pdb
</pre>
Use <i>Display</i> <i>Backbone</i> to display only the backbone trace and
<i>Colours</i> <i>Group</i> for a color coding from N- to C-terminus.
<BR><BR>
From the average cluster HADDOCK score, cluster 1 is clearly the best. 
<BR><BR>
It can however happen that the difference in score is small. Since the AIR restraints 
defined from NMR chemical shift perturbation data (or other sources) are highly ambiguous, 
they are typically easily satisfied and might not discriminate well between various orientations, 
e.g. a 180 degree rotation of one protein with respect to the other around an axis 
perpendicular to the interface. Some degree of asymmetry either in the interface 
(electrostatic, shape) or in additional experimental data is thus required, or even better, 
additional experimental information could be used to discriminate between clusters (e.g.
mutagenesis or conservation data).
<BR><BR>
<ul><font color=red>
Inspect in Rasmol or any graphic program the best solution of each cluster (it is the
first one in the respective analysis directories, <i>e2a-hprfit_1.pdb</i>) and try to
figure out the differences between them. Check in particular the relative orientation
of the two protein.</font color=red>
</ul>
<br>
For this particular test case, the reference structure is known and has been solved 
by NMR<sup>5</sup>. In order to compare our docking solutions with the reference
structure we are providing csh scripts called <i>i-rmsd_to_target.csh</i> for interface RMSD 
calculation and <i>l-rmsd_to_target.csh</i> for ligand RMSD calculations. These can be found in the
<i><b>e2a-hpr/ana_scripts</b></i> directory. These script takes as arguments PDB filenames and 
calculates various rmsd values from the reference structure using ProFit.
<BR><BR>
Copy the script in the clusters respective analysis directories and run them with as argument 
<i>*.pdb</i>:
<pre>
   ./i-rmsd_to_target.csh *.pdb
   ./l-rmsd_to_target.csh *.pdb
</pre>
Four files will be created:
<ul>
   <li><i>i-RMSD.disp</i>: inteface RMSD for the PDB files in the same order as passed as arguments
   <li><i>i-RMSD-sorted.disp</i>: interface RMSD sorted from smallest to largest
   <li><i>l-RMSD.disp</i>: ligand RMSD for the PDB files in the same order as passed as arguments
   <li><i>l-RMSD-sorted.disp</i>: ligand RMSD sorted from smallest to largest
</ul>
<ul><font color=red><b>Question:</b>
Which one of the two clusters is the closest to the target?
</font color=red>
</ul>
According to <a href="http://capri.ebi.ac.uk">CAPRI</a> criteria, a docking model with i-RMSD or l-RMSD below 1A can be considered as a
high accuracy predition. A medium quality prediction will have a i-RMSD below 2A and/or l-RMSD below 5A.
Acceptable predictions should have i-RMSD below 4A or l-RMSD below 10A.
<ul>
    <b>Note</b> that you can also run those scripts for it0, it1 or water structures. Copy the scripts
                in the respective directories and type:
<pre>
./i-rmsd_to_target.csh `cat file.nam`
</pre>
The i-RMSD.disp file will now be sorted in according to the HADDOCK score.
</ul>
<br>
Another measure of quality defined in <a href="http://capri.ebi.ac.uk">CAPRI</a> is the fraction of
native contacts. Native contacts are defined as intermolecular contact between residues 
within 5A from each other. A script to calculate the fraction of native contacts is provided in the
<b>e2a-hpr/ana_scripts</b> directory: <i>fraction-native.csh</i>. It takes as arguments a list of PDB
files in the same manner as the RMSD scripts described above. For example, to calculate the fraction 
of native contacts of the water-refined structures, copy this script in the <b>water</b> directory 
and type:
<pre>
./fraction-native.csh `cat file.nam`
</pre>
This will generate a file called <i>file.nam_fnat</i> containing the fraction of native contacts.
<BR><BR>
<br>
Finally, there is one additional piece of information that we did not use for the docking
and that could help in discriminating further the clusters:
<ul><font color=blue>
   E2A stands for phosphotransferase enzyme II and HPr for histidine-containing
   phosphocarrier protein. There is thus transfer of a phosphate group between two
   histidines of those two proteins!
</ul></font color=blue>
<br>
<font color=red><b>Question:</b>
Inspect again graphically the best solution of each cluster and find out if, in one 
of them, there are two histidines (one from each protein) at reasonable proximity from
each other?
<BR><BR>
<b>Question:</b>Which cluster is consistent with this additional information?
<BR><BR>
<b>Question:</b>To improve the docking results, how would you incorporate this information in HADDOCK
(the phosphate group is transfered between two imino groups of histidines)?
