Diffusion anisotropy data (relaxation data) can provide useful information on the orientation of the
molecules to be docked (comparable to RDCs). They can be introduced in HADDOCK as direct restraints
(DANI statement in CNS).
<BR>
For this, the tensor components need first to be determined. In the case of complexes, this
can be easily done by using the known structures of the single domains. The software
<a href="http://www.ibs.fr/ext/labos/LRMN/softs/">Tensor2</a> 
(Dosset, Marion and Blackledge (2000). <i>J. Biomol. NMR</i> <b>16</b>, 23-28) can 
be used for this purpose.
<BR>
<BR>
You need for this to generate a <a href="http://www.ibs.fr/ext/labos/LRMN/softs/tensor/TENSORV2_DOC/Practice.html#prac3">
Tensor2 input file</a> containing your relaxation data.
<BR>
<BR>
A csh script called <i>ana_pdb_tensor2.csh</i> is provided in the 
<b>haddock/DANItools</b> directory that will calculate from the experimental
relaxation data the tensor parameters for all PDB files present in the 
current directory by best-fitting the data to the
corresponding 3D structures.
<BR>
<BR>
Usage:
<BR>
<BR>
<pre>
   $HADDOCK/DANItools/ana_pdb_tensor2.csh tensor2.inp
</pre>
<BR>
Note that you have to define the fitting options in the tensor2 GUI manually. Tensor2 writes its output
for each structure to a file called <i>resaniso.0</i>; each of these are moved to a subdirectory with directory name
equal to the corresponding pdb file.
<BR>
<BR>
The script extracts the tensor parameters Dx, Dy and Dz and the chi2-value of the fit; these can be combined with the 
following command:
<BR>
<BR>
<pre>
    paste D?_all.tmp chi2_all.tmp | awk '{print $1,$8,$16,$24,$27*100/100}' | sort -n +4 > tensor2_fit.lis
</pre>
<BR>
The components from the structure giving the best fit to the 
experimental data can be used to calculate the tensor parameters that are needed in run.cns with the 
script <i>calc_tens.csh</i> (provided in the <b>haddock/DANItools</b> directory).
<BR>
<BR>
Usage:
<BR>
<BR>
<pre>
    $HADDOCK/DANItools/calc_tens.csh dx dy dz
</pre>
<BR>
Where dx, dy and dz are the values from the file <i>tensor2_fit.lis</i>.
The output of <i>calc_tens.csh</i> can be used directly in run.cns as <i>dan1_tc</i>,
<i>dan1_anis</i> and <i>dan1_r</i>, the rotational correlation time, anisotropy and rhombicity of the
rotational diffusion tensor, respectively.
Alternatively, average values could be used; these can be calculated with:
<BR>
<BR>
<pre>
   cat tensor2_fit.lis | awk '{print $2}' | $HADDOCKTOOLS/average.perl
   cat tensor2_fit.lis | awk '{print $3}' | $HADDOCKTOOLS/average.perl
   cat tensor2_fit.lis | awk '{print $4}' | $HADDOCKTOOLS/average.perl
</pre>
<BR>
Check the values in tensor2_fit.lis to make sure they match (e.g. same sign) 
before averaging them. Also make sure that an anisotropic model is in accordance with your data.

<a name="dani"><b><u> Use of relaxation data as restraints for docking</u></b></a>
<BR>
<BR>
The proper format for DANI restraints is the following:
<BR>
<BR>
<pre>
assi ( resid 999 and name OO )
     ( resid 999 and name Z  )
     ( resid 999 and name X  )
     ( resid 999 and name Y  )
     ( resid   20 and name N and segid A )
     ( resid   20 and name HN and segid A )   8.705   0.200
</pre>
<BR>
The restraints use the R2/R1 value; one should filter out residues where chemical exchange or mobility influences these values.
Given a file containing <i>residue_number R2/R1value</i> and <i>Segid</i> a DANI
restraint file in CNS format can be generated with the gawk script 
<i>generate_dani</i> provided in the <b>HADDOCK/DANItools</b> directory:
<BR>
<BR>
<pre>
    $HADDOCK/DANItools/generate_dani dani_data_file
</pre>
<BR>
The error on the R2/R1 values is set by default to 0.2. This can be overruled by
giving the error value as argument:
<BR>
<BR>
<pre>
    $HADDOCK/DANItools/generate_dani ERR=0.5 dani_data_file
</pre>
<BR>
The 2.2 version of HADDOCK supports up to 5 different DANI restraints sets. Each can have a separate tensor. 
The tensor residue number should be in the range 999-995. You can edit and modify the <i>generate_dani</i> script to change the tensor number.
To use DANI restraints in HADDOCK, use <i>DANI</i> in <a HREF="/software/haddock2.2/run.html#dani">run.cns</a>
in the diffusion anisotropy section and define the proper tensor parameters that are output by the <i>calc_tens.csh</i> script. 

The DANI restraints are first used in the 
<a HREF="/software/haddock2.2/docking.html#mini">rigid body energy minimization step</a> using
as force constant the value defined for the hot phase.
